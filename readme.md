# Competitive Programing Solutions

I would like to welcome you to my competitice programming solutions.   I will storing solutions to problems from my adventures in competitive programming.  

The sites I am currently using to train are:

I also am the director of a high school programming series called the Florida High School Programming Series.   I will be posting my solutions here as well.

Hopefully you will find this interesting and useful.
